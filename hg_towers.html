                <h3>Rule an Ancient City</h3>
                <!-- Text is put in a paragraph tag. -->
                <p>Towers and Temples is the winner of the 2017 Palmer Medal for Best New Simulation Board Game. Players adopt
                    role cards of characters from ancient Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage the administration of a
                    city. Each role provides a different ability and strategy. However, one role card belongs to a deadly
                    assassin and players must be constantly aware of betrayal and double-cross. This card game provides a
                    ton of enjoyment and can handle up to eight players and expansion packs available for larger parties.</p>

                <p>This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must carefully choose his or her roles and the strategies
                    can quickly change with the turn of a card. However the level of randomness is just right and cunning
                    and resourcefulness can overcome bad luck (if given time.) I do not recommend this game unless there
                    are at least 4 players; less than that reduces the intrigue and some of the game appeal.</p>

                <h3>Highly Recommended</h3>
                <p>Towers and Temples is a great game. The balance is just about perfect and each player must carefully choose
                    roles each turn. Even though the strategic possibilities are nearly endless, the game is simple to learn.
                    The replay value is high and gets even better when you replace some of the cards with new cards available
                    in the expansion packs.

                <h3>Great Strategic Board Game</h3>
                <p>We tested Towers and Temples with everything from 2 to 6 players and we can strongly recommend the game.
                    The different phases of the game are interesting and intriguing, from bluffing and stealing to site construction
                    and planning. With the variety of cards and scenarios, no two games are ever quite the same. It's a great
                    introduction to the world of strategic board games and role playing.</p>

                <h3>An Incredible Game</h3>
                <p>The artwork on the cards and the board is excellent and one of the best around. As for play, this game offers
                    lots of strategy, and there are tough decisions to make every turn. It's not only important to select
                    the character that increases your chances for scoring, but also to anticipate the characters the opponents
                    are likely to select, and then hedge against their availability. This causes a lot of unpredictability
                    and deep strategic thinking. However, it can still be played at a more basic level for younger users.</p>

                <p>We had a lot of fun with this game and rate it as Best in its Class. Highly recommended.</p>
